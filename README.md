# Projects

This repository hosts projects that I build for myself but think may be useful to the community. Each project is designed to be independent and serves a specific purpose. Below is a brief overview of the projects currently available:

## Nanakshahi Calendar

The Nanakshahi Calendar project provides a webpage for subscribing to the Nanakshahi Calendar. It includes significant Sikh historical dates and Gurpurabs, which can be synced with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.

More projects will be added to this repository in the future. Stay tuned!
